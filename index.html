        <h3>Characterizing Post-Publication Changes to Online News</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        The focus of this work is to study the extent to which post-publication
        changes happen to news articles. We collect articles over a period of 9
        months from news publishers of varying popularity and political biases
        and show that 165k out of 600k articles exhibit some post-publication
        changes. We also leverage Natural Language Processing to measure
        the semantics of these changes, such as whether a change alters the
        meaning of the paragraph it occurs in - which, in 22% of cases, it
        does.
